# Exercise 05 - Creating, deploying & instantiating a simple workflow

In this exercise you'll create the simplest workflow definition possible, and deploy it to SAP Cloud Platform, whereupon you'll use the workflow related apps you set up in your Portal service powered Fiori launchpad site to create an instance of the definition and look at it.

## Steps

After completing these steps you'll understand the general flow of development, deployment and usage of workflows on SAP Cloud Platform, specifically in the Cloud Foundry environment.

### 1. Create a new Workflow project in the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack

:point_right: Open up the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack (you may have it already open from the previous exercise) and create a new project with menu path "File -> New -> Project from Template". In the steps that follow, make these selections:

**Template Selection**

| Property               | Value                   |
| -------------          | ----------------------- |
| Environment filter     | Cloud Foundry           |
| Category filter        | All Categories          |
| Template selection     | Multi-Target Application |

**Basic Information**

| Property               | Value                   |
| -------------          | ----------------------- |
| Project Name           | OrderFlow               |

**Template Customization**

| Property               | Value                   |
| -------------          | ----------------------- |
| Application ID         | OrderFlow (i.e. leave as-is) |
| Application Version    | 0.0.1 (i.e. leave as-is) |
| Description            | (leave blank)             |
| Use HTML Application Repository checkbox | (leave unchecked) |


If you expand the resulting project structure you'll see that not much has been generated - merely an `mta.yaml` file that has very little in it right now. Go on, take a look inside the file ... you're curious, right?

> If you have "Show hidden files" turned on (via the "eye" icon) in your SAP Web IDE Development perspective, you'll also see a directory called `.che/` too, but this is related to the IDE itself rather than the workflow project specifically, so you can ignore it.

The idea of a multi-target application is that it is made up from multiple parts - one or more modules, with dependencies on one or more resources. This workflow project will be no different.

:point_right: Add a module now, a workflow module specifically, by using the context menu on the `OrderFlow` project name and choosing "New -> Workflow Module". Use the following selections:

**Basic Information**

| Property               | Value                   |
| -------------          | ----------------------- |
| Module Name            | OrderProcess            |

**Workflow Details**

| Property               | Value                   |
| -------------          | ----------------------- |
| Name                   | orderprocess            |
| Description            | (leave blank)           |

_Note: the names of the module, and the workflow definition within it, are deliberately different here, to highlight that they're not the same thing - you can have multiple workflow definitions in a single workflow module._

You should end up with a very simple workflow definition, that looks like this:

![simple workflow definition](simpleworkflowdefinition.png)

Observe that the workflow definition editor is graphical (it's the one you [enabled in Exercise 01](../01#4-set-up-the-sap-web-ide)), and the file that represents the definition is within a `workflows/` directory within the project.

In the last part of this step, we need to turn our attention to what's been added to the `mta.yaml` file as a result of adding this workflow module. Open it in the Code Editor and take a look - it should look something like this:

```yaml
ID: OrderFlow
_schema-version: '2.1'
version: 0.0.1
modules:
  - name: OrderProcess
    type: com.sap.application.content
    path: OrderProcess
    requires:
      - name: workflow_OrderFlow
        parameters:
          content-target: true
resources:
  - name: workflow_OrderFlow
    parameters:
      service-plan: standard
      service: workflow
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
```

You can see that there's now a single module defined, with the name `OrderProcess`, which requires a Workflow service resource named `workflow_OrderFlow`, of type `org.cloudfoundry.managed-service`. The name of this resource is generated from the word "workflow" plus the name of the overall project "OrderFlow".

But we already have a Workflow service instance called "workflow" so we need to adapt the references here.

:point_right: Change the two references `workflow_OrderFlow` to `workflow`, i.e. both in the "requires" section of the module, and in the "name" section of the resource. Also change the "type" of the resource to `org.cloudfoundry.existing-service`. (You did something very similar to this in [exercise 02](../02#2-modify-the-mtayaml-file-to-reflect-the-existing-workflow-service-instance).)

:point_right: Change the service-plan of workflow resource from `standard` to `lite`

The result should look like this:

```yaml
ID: OrderFlow
_schema-version: '2.1'
version: 0.0.1
modules:
  - name: OrderProcess
    type: com.sap.application.content
    path: OrderProcess
    requires:
      - name: workflow
        parameters:
          content-target: true
resources:
  - name: workflow
    parameters:
      service-plan: lite
      service: workflow
    type: org.cloudfoundry.existing-service
```

Don't forget to save your changes!


### 2. Deploy the definition to the cloud

While this workflow definition doesn't do very much, we can still carry out an initial exploration with the apps we made available in the Fiori launchpad in [Exercise 02](../02). So in this step we'll build and deploy the workflow definition to SAP Cloud Platform to be able to do that.

:point_right: Use the context menu on the "OrderFlow" project item and choose "Build -> Build with Cloud MTA Build Tool (recommended)".

This should complete in a few moments, and create a new directory `mta_archives/` within the project structure, containing an `.mtar` archive file ready to be deployed.

:point_right: Deploy that file, it will most likely be called `OrderFlow_0.0.1.mtar`, using the context menu on the file name and choosing "Deploy -> Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform".

> You may have to reconfirm your desired Cloud Foundry (CF) endpoint at this stage - make sure you choose the same dev space as before.

This deployment should also complete quite quickly. If you examine the contents of the `mta.yaml` file that you just edited, and also check the Applications and Service Instances sections of your "CF Dev Space Home" in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit, you'll see that this was a content deployment, rather than instantiation of any new CF service instances or applications. This makes sense, as it's a deployment of the workflow definition to the Workflow service instance.


### 3. Examine the workflow definition and create an instance of it

:point_right: Go to your Fiori launchpad site and start the "Monitor Workflows - Workflow Definitions" app. You should see something like this:

![orderprocess workflow definition](workflowdefinitionv1.png)

You can see that this is version 1 of the definition, the first version you've deployed (the version number is incremented automatically on each new deploy).

Here you can start a new instance, which is what you should do now. Built in to the system is some simple test data that can be used to populate new instances of workflow definitions for testing purposes. You can, if you wish, modify or completely overwrite the test data.

:point_right: Use the "Start New Instance" button, and in the dialog that appears, leave the test data as it is, and continue with the "Start New Instance" button to have an instance of your workflow definition created. A message should appear briefly to confirm that.

### 4. Look at the workflow instance

:point_right: Switch to looking at the workflow instance you created, by using the "Show Instances" button.

You should see a filtered display in the master list ... but it's likely that you won't see your newly created instance. This is because the default filter is to show instances with the following status values:

- Erroneous
- Running
- Suspended

Because of the simplicity of your workflow definition right now, the instance has already completed.

:point_right: Use the filter icon at the bottom of the master list to add the status "Completed" to the status values.

You should now see your instance. There's plenty of information to examine.

:point_right: Take a couple of minutes to explore the information.

### 5. Create another workflow instance with different data

Before finishing this exercise, it's worth going through the process of manually creating a workflow instance again, this time supplying different data.

:point_right: Navigate back to the display of the workflow definition, and use the "Start New Instance" button again. This time, replace the entire test data (relating to the Hamlet book) with the following:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "Id": "HT-1001",
    "Quantity": 5
  }
}
```

Examining the completed instance this time, you should see this data in the Workflow Context section.

## Summary

You've now gone through the process of bringing a workflow definition from your development environment (the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack) to the Workflow service on the SAP Cloud Platform CF environment, and using the administration apps to create and examine instances of it. You'll find that the "Monitor Workflows" app is a very useful tool.

## Questions

1. There are two tiles to look at workflow information - definitions and instances. Are there actually two apps? How did you jump from looking at your definition to looking at instances of it? What changed in the URL when you jumped?

1. What sort of information did you find when examining the completed workflow instance? Did you understand what everything was? What was in the workflow context, and what did you see when you selected "Show Tasks"?
